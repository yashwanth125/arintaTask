frequency of bowel movements. anywhere from three times a day to three times a week is considered normal.as long as stools are easy to pass, laxatives should not be used in an effort to force the body to a more frequent schedule.constipation is usually caused by lack of fiber in the diet; not drinking enough water; insufficient exercise; and often suppressing the urge to have a bowel movement.a number of medications and remedies, especially narcotic pain relievers, can cause constipation.women are often affected, due to pregnancy and other hormonal changes. young children who demand low-fiber or \\\\\"junk food\\\\\" diets are also susceptible.constipation is a condition, not a disease, and most of the time is easily corrected. if simple adjustments in diet, exercise, and bowel

abdominal pain radiating to the right shoulder; and sometimes nausea and vomiting. a gallbladder infection is an acute (sudden) illness, while the symptoms of gallstones come on gradually.untreated cholecystitis can lead to rupture of the gallbladder, which can be life-threatening.diagnosis is made through physical examination, ultrasound or other imaging, and blood tests.treatment involves hospitalizing the patient for fasting with iv fluids, to rest the gallbladder; antibiotics; and pain medication. surgery to remove the gallbladder is often done so that the condition cannot

abdominal pain, foul-smelling vaginal discharge, pain and/or bleeding during sex, and pain on urination.untreated pid can cause infertility due to damaged tissue in the reproductive tract, as well as chronic pelvic and abdominal pain. unprotected sex partners will be infected as well.diagnosis is made through symptoms, pelvic examination, vaginal and cervical swabs, and urine tests.treatment is

month. but sometimes the egg remains on the surface of the ovary, where the follicle that enclosed it continues to grow. it then becomes a fluid-filled ovarian cyst.ovarian cysts may be caused by hormonal imbalances; by endometriosis tissue, if it attaches to the ovary; and by severe pelvic infections that spread to the ovaries. cysts may also form during pregnancy.small ovarian cysts often cause no symptoms. larger cysts may cause pelvic pain, backache, unexplained weight gain, abnormal vaginal bleeding, and/or pain during sex. ovarian cysts are almost never a form of cancer.sudden, severe abdominal pain could indicate a ruptured cyst. this is a medical emergency and the patient should go to an emergency room or call 9-1-1.diagnosis is made through ultrasound.hormonal birth

often a complication of cystic ovaries.it is most common in women under thirty or past menopause. it can occur during pregnancy.symptoms include severe, one-sided, lower abdominal pain with nausea and

medical emergency. the ovary can die due to loss of circulation, causing infection, abscess, or peritonitis. surgery must be done to prevent tissue death and subsequent complications. in the majority of cases the affected ovary must be removed, which also removes the cyst or mass that caused the torsion.proper treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) can help prevent at least one cause of

invasion with white blood cells, which kill some of the infected tissue but form pus within the cavity that remains.symptoms include a large, red, swollen, painful lump of pus anywhere on the body beneath the skin. there may be fever, chills, and body aches from the infection.if not treated, there is the risk of an abscess enlarging, spreading, and causing serious illness.diagnosis is made through physical examination.a small abscess may heal on its own, through the body\\'s immune system. but some will need to be drained or lanced in a medical provider\\'s office so that the pus can be

constipation, but can also have alternating diarrhea and constipation. ibs is known as a functional gastrointestinal disorder[1], which means there is no underlying structural problem to account for the symptoms.bacterial overgrowth:there are millions of bacteria in a normal, health gastrointestinal system. however, some people get overgrowth of abnormal bacteria in place of good bacteria which can be a cause of abdominal bloating or swelling. typically, bacterial overgrowth presents with abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, gas, and diarrhea and diarrhea and is usually located in the

complaint of nonspecific abdominal pain and discomfort, with no apparent cause, is one of the most common in medicine. it is a primary reason for patients to visit a medical provider or the emergency

organs.the pain may simply be caused by overly sensitive nerves in the gut. this hypersensitivity can occur after repeated abdominal injury and/or it may have an emotional cause due to fear of the pain itself.diagnosis is made through physical examination, patient history, and simply ruling out any other condition. ct scan is often requested, but can rarely find a specific cause. the benefits

causes or irritation from a variety of substances, including certain foods.infectious:there are many pathogens, both bacterial and viral, that can infect the organs of the abdomen, particularly in the upper right quadrant. for example, hepatitis is a viral infection that can infect the liver.irritation:since the upper abdomen is the primary location for food to be processed for digestion, it is susceptible to irritation in multiple ways. toxic substances such as alcohol and smoking can cause irritation that leads to inflammation and ulceration. certain medications such as non-steroidal inflammatory drugs (nsaids) can lead to irritation of the stomach lining with overuse. moreover, the acid that the stomach makes to digest food can irritate the components of the digestive tract, including the esophagus, and this can also cause postprandial pain.obstructive causesthe following can result in obstructions of the gastrointestinal system.cancer:cancer can develop in any organ of the abdomen/digestive tract. malignancies of the pancreas or stomach are often related to postprandial pain given their necessity to proper digestion.gallstones:the upper right quadrant of the abdomen is specifically home to the gallbladder. the gallbladder is part of the digestive system and responsible for making bile, a fluid that helps break down fat. often, stones (gallstones) can form inside the gallbladder. these gallstones can vary in size and cause many problems that may result in postprandial pain when the body tries to break down fats.10 possible abdominal pain that get worse after

the blood flow to the large and/or small intestines has been cut off. it is also called acute mesenteric ischemia, or ami.the ischemia is caused by blockage in one of the arteries leading into the abdomen, usually due to atherosclerosis (plaque) or a blood clot.most susceptible are those with very high or low blood pressure; heart disease; or using illegal drugs such as cocaine or methamphetamine.symptoms include sudden, severe pain in one area of the abdomen; nausea and vomiting; and repeated, urgent bowel movements, often with blood.acute intestinal ischemia is a life-threatening medical emergency. if it is suspected, take the patient to the emergency room or call 9-1-1.diagnosis is made through arteriogram, which involves injecting dye into the abdominal arteries under x-ray in order to find the exact location of the blockage.treatment involves \\\\\"clot-busting\\\\\" drugs to destroy a clot, or emergency surgery to remove whatever is causing the

severe pain in the back and abdomen, especially with eating; weight loss; nausea and vomiting; and diarrhea with oily-appearing, pale-colored stools.the pancreas is vital for blood sugar control and for secreting certain digestive enzymes. if not treated, chronic pancreatitis can lead to permanent pancreatic damage, diabetes, malnutrition, and chronic pain.diagnosis is made through patient history, physical examination, and imaging such as x-ray, ct scan, or ultrasound.treatment involves pain management through both medication and surgical procedures. lifestyle improvements through

treatments and relieftreatment for your postprandial pain will be dependent on the cause. there are multiple treatment modalities that may provide relief.at-home treatmentsfortunately, since most causes of postprandial pain are relatively benign, there are treatments you can first try at home to help alleviate your symptoms. antacids are common over-the-counter medications (tums, pepto-bismol, etc.) that can be very helpful in relieving some causes of postprandial pain because they work to neutralize excess stomach acid. however, antacids will not help with inflammatory or obstructive causes of postprandial pain.when to see a doctorif your symptoms persist despite the at-home remedies above, make an appointment with your doctor to receive a proper diagnosis. once your doctor has determined a possible cause, he or she may recommend:medications:for example, in the case of gallstones, there are some medications that can break them up without the need for surgery. if your symptoms are due to infection, you may receive antibiotics to relieve your condition.surgery:surgery to remove gallstones or the gallbladder entirely is a very common procedure, especially for people who suffer from chronic gallstones. often, the entire gallbladder is removed.bowel rest:your doctor may suggest a lighter diet that will allow your intestines and digestive system to recover after inflammatory or infectious causes of abdominal pain[2].when it is an emergencyseek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms including:sudden, severe painfeverbloody stoolsnausea and vomiting that persistsweight losssevere tenderness when you touch your abdomenswelling of the abdomenthese could be signs of a serious obstruction or inflammation of the organs of the abdomen that needs immediate assessment.preventionthere are also many strategies you can try in order to stay a step ahead of your symptoms.limit nsaid use:non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (advil, motrin) or naproxen (aleve) can cause and/or aggravate postprandial pain. talk to your doctor about alternatives you can use.limit consumption of spicy, fatty, or acidic foods:certain foods in these categories (caffeine, carbonated beverages, citrus fruits or juices, etc.) are believed to be triggers of postprandial pain.avoid alcohol and quit smoking:alcohol and smoking are associated with increased production of stomach acid and thus irritation of the abdominal lining.faqs about abdominal pain that get worse after eatingcan i prevent postprandial pain?yes, depending on the cause. making lifestyle changes, such as limiting your use of alcohol or nsaids, can also reduce the chance for ulceration of your stomach lining (peptic or gastric ulcers). you can also prevent symptoms by stopping smoking or not taking up smoking in the first place.what is helicobacter pylori?helicobacter pylori are bacteria that specifically infect the gastrointestinal tract. the inflammation and irritation this bacteria causes can lead to conditions such as gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and even gastric cancer. more than half of the world\\\\u2019s population is colonized by these bacteria[3]. fortunately, the management and treatment of helicobacter pylori infections are well-studied.how are helicobacter pylori transmitted?even though there are many hypotheses for how helicobacter pylori are transmitted, their major mode of transmission is not specifically known. possible routes of infection include oral-oral (from human saliva to human saliva), fecal-oral (accidental contamination of food with feces), and sometimes spread via inadvertent use of unsterile medical equipment such as probes or endoscopes[4].how can i live without my gallbladder?gallbladder removal is a very common surgery. removal of the gallbladder does not significantly affect digestion because the liver can also make bile to help with the break down of fatty foods. symptoms experienced after gallbladder removal include gas, bloating, or more watery bowel movements. fortunately, there is a very small chance that gallstones will recur after removal.is postprandial pain life-threatening?some causes of postprandial pain such as pancreatitis can be very serious and severe. according to a large epidemiologic study from the united states, approximately 15-25% of patients with acute pancreatitis develop severe pancreatitis[5]. severe pancreatitis can result in fever, hypotension, and organ failure and require monitoring in the intensive care unit. it is important to not ignore symptoms of pain in the upper abdomen and seek medical attention before the condition worsens.questions your doctor may ask about abdominal pain that get worse after eatingto diagnose this

during digestion are vegetables, beans, whole grains, and dairy products. some artificial sweeteners have the same effect, as do carbonated sodas and beers.a normal amount of gas in the digestive tract is not painful, or even uncomfortable, beyond a slight temporary pressure or temporary sensation of bloating within the abdomen. these symptoms will be relieved simply by passing the gas out of the rectum, or by having a bowel movement.most susceptible to excessive, or painful, amounts of gas are those with almost any digestive tract disorder. this is because normal digestion, breakdown, and

lump in the abdomen is usually the result of the collection or growth of underlying structures in the abdomen. there are various specific structures within the abdominal region including:muscles:the muscles of the groin are called the adductor muscles. these muscles allow you to bring your thighs together and work with other muscles in movements such as bringing the knees to the chest. furthermore, the muscles of the abdomen also connect in this area.fat:there is a layer of fatty tissue under the skin that stores energy, insulates/regulates the body\\\\u2019s temperature and serves as a protective cushion.lymphatics:underneath the skin, there are three to five lymph nodes \\\\u2014 structures throughout the body that play an important role in allowing the body to fight off infectionsother conditions in the following sections can also lead to the development of a hard abdominal lump[1].herniaa hernia occurs when part of an organ pushes through an opening or weakness in the muscles or tissues that surround it[2]. the protruding organ can result in a noticeable lump or bulge in the area. usually, a hard lump in the abdomen is the result of the following:surgical:a surgical incision is essentially the creation of a weakness in the abdominal wall. after surgery, the abdominal wall is closed; however, factors such as weight gain, pregnancy, or excessive activity too soon after the procedure can result in an increase in abdominal pressure and stretching of the incision before it is completely healed. this makes it easy for contents to protrude through the incision, resulting in a hernia[3].developmental:a developmental hernia, also called umbilical hernia, arises when intestinal content protrudes through the hole the umbilical cord passed through at birth[4]. this hardlump is located in the area of the belly buttonand is easily identifiable in newborns and small children. there are other types of hernias such as epigastric or spigelian that can also result due to improper development of the abdominal structures[5].other causesother causes that can lead to hard abdominal lumps include:lymphatic:the lymph nodes are structures that contain immune cells that fight infection and filter harmful substances from the body. when these structures become infected, they can swell and result in palpable lumps. the abdomen contains some lymph nodes that are susceptible to infection and swelling. if swollen lymph nodes are causing the lump in your abdomen you may also experience tenderness and fever as well.cancerous:a hard lump in the abdomen, especially in the abdomen of a child, can be a sign of a cancerous condition called neuroblastoma[6]. it is very important to follow up with your physician if you notice a hard lump in that area accompanied by symptoms such as pain, weight loss or an enlarged belly[7].10 possible hard abdominal lump conditionsthe list below shows results from the use of our quiz by buoy users who experienced hard abdominal lump. this list does not constitute medical advice and may not accurately represent what you have.lipomalipoma is a word that translates as \\\\\"fatty tumor,\\\\\" but a lipoma is not cancer. it is simply a growth of fat between the muscle layer and the skin above it.the exact cause is not known. the condition does run in families and is associated with other unusual syndromes such as adiposis dolorosa, which is similar. lipomas most often appear after age 40.symptoms include a soft, easily moveable lump beneath the skin, about two inches across. a lipoma is painless unless its growth is irritating the nerves around it. they are most often found on the back, neck, and abdomen, and sometimes the arms and upper legs.it is a good idea to have any new or unusual growth checked by a medical provider, just to make certain it is benign.diagnosis is made through physical examination, biopsy, and imaging such as ultrasound or ct scan.most of the time, treatment is not necessary unless the lipoma is unsightly or is interfering with other structures. it can be removed through surgery or liposuction.rarity:uncommontop symptoms:skin-colored groin bump, marble sized groin lump,

month. but sometimes the egg remains on the surface of the ovary, where the follicle that enclosed it continues to grow. it then becomes a fluid-filled ovarian cyst.ovarian cysts may be caused by hormonal imbalances; by endometriosis tissue, if it attaches to the ovary; and by severe pelvic infections that spread to the ovaries. cysts may also form during pregnancy.small ovarian cysts often cause no symptoms. larger cysts may cause pelvic pain, backache, unexplained weight gain, abnormal vaginal bleeding, and/or pain during sex. ovarian cysts are almost never a form of cancer.sudden, severe abdominal pain could indicate a ruptured cyst. this is a medical emergency and the patient should go to an emergency room or call 9-1-1.diagnosis is made through ultrasound.hormonal birth control, such as the pill, injection, or patch, prevents ovulation and therefore prevents the formation of cysts. surgery to remove the cyst may be necessary in some cases.rarity:raretop

doctorwhen and how to treat a hard lump on the stomachwhen to see a doctorsince the causes of hard abdominal lumps are varied, it is important to make an appointment with your physician in order to get the proper diagnosis and treatment. depending on the cause of your symptoms, your physician may suggest:surgery:if an incisional or an umbilical hernia is causing your hard abdominal lump, your physician may suggest open or non-invasive surgery to relieve discomfort and prevent complications. however, if your hernia is not causing you significant pain or discomfort, your physician may suggest watchful waiting.antibiotics:if you have swollen lymph nodes due to infection, your physician will provide appropriate antibiotic treatment.cancer treatment:if your hard abdominal lump and associated symptoms are due to cancer, your physician will discuss treatment options including surgery, radiation or chemotherapy.when it is an emergencyseek immediate treatment in an emergency room or call 911 if the following occur:nauseaand/orvomitingfeverpain that is sudden and increases in intensitylump changes colorinability to pass gasthese could be signs of an incarcerated hernia. a hernia is incarcerated when it becomes trapped in the abdominal wall. incarcerated hernias are dangerous because they can wrap around themselves and cut off blood flow to the trapped tissue. when this occurs, a strangulated hernia results, which can have life-threatening consequences if not treated promptly.faqs about hard abdominal lumpwhy can my hard abdominal lump be moved/pushed back into my abdomen sometimes?this phenomenon is called reducibility. often the protrusion of contents can be easily pushed back into the opening or weakness, signaling that the lump can be fixed or treated by properly closing the hole. often reduction of the lump can help alleviate associated symptoms and delay the need for surgery.will a hard abdominal lump affect my digestion?depending on the cause of your hard abdominal lump, your digestion may be affected. in the case of cancer, a growth may block the flow of food and affect digestion as well as cause symptoms such as pain, nausea, and vomiting. however, in the case of conditions such as incisional or umbilical hernias, the digestion is not usually affected.can i still exercise with a hard abdominal lump?exercise is acceptable if you take precautions to avoid aggravating the abdominal tissues or increasing intra-abdominal pressure. low-intensity or low-impact exercises such as dancing, walking or water aerobics may be good options. however, activities such as heavy weightlifting can cause strain in that area and increase pressure in the abdomen causing the lump to bulge unnecessarily. always speak with your physician before beginning an exercise regimen.after repairing my abdominal lump, when can i start exercise?when you can resume exercise and other physical activity will depend on the size of your lump and the type of repair that was performed. however, most people can return to their normal level of physical activity after four to six weeks.can a hard abdominal lump be inherited?some abdominal lumps related to cancerous processes can be inherited. for example, the mutation that causes some forms of neuroblastoma in children can be inherited. however, for conditions such as surgical or developmental hernias, there is no hereditary component.questions your doctor may ask about hard abdominal lumpto diagnose this condition, your doctor would likely ask the following questions:what color is the bump?how

abdomenurgency:hospital emergency roomnormal abdominal painthe complaint of nonspecific abdominal pain and discomfort, with no apparent cause, is one of the most common in medicine. it is a primary reason for patients to visit a medical provider or the emergency room.the cause of abdominal pain can be difficult to find, because it can come from many different sources: the digestive tract, the urinary tract, the pancreas, the gall bladder, or the gynecologic organs.the pain may simply be caused by overly sensitive nerves in the gut. this hypersensitivity can occur after repeated abdominal injury and/or it may have an emotional cause due to fear of the pain itself.diagnosis is made through physical examination, patient history, and simply ruling out any other condition. ct scan is often requested, but can rarely find a specific cause. the benefits must be weighed against the risks of radiation.treatment first involves making any needed lifestyle improvements regarding diet, exercise, work, and sleep, in order to reduce stress. in some cases, counseling, hypnosis, mild pain relievers, and antidepressants are helpful.rarity:commontop symptoms:abdominal pain (stomach ache), vaginal

never associated with cancer.those at higher risk include black women and women who started their periods at a young age. other risk factors are vitamin d deficiency, poor diet, obesity, drinking alcohol, and family history of fibroids.fibroids can cause pelvic pressure and pain, severe menstrual cramping, and heavy menstrual bleeding that leads to anemia. quality of life is diminished due to the chronic pain and discomfort. though fibroids don\\'t always make it impossible to become pregnant, infertility and pregnancy loss may occur as well as pre-term delivery.fibroids can be diagnosed through a routine pelvic exam or ultrasound in a doctor\\'s office.a gynecologist can prescribe various medications to ease the symptoms and regulate the menstrual cycle. there are also a number of surgical techniques, some minimally invasive, to shrink or remove the fibroids while leaving the uterus in place. hysterectomy, or removal of the uterus, is an option in some cases.rarity:commontop

irritation caused by clothes or anything else rubbing the skin can cause the skin to break down and allow bacteria to enter.staph bacteria are found everywhere. frequent and thorough handwashing, and

the skin that is swollen, painful, and red, and contains pus.it is important to treat the boil, since infection can spread into the bloodstream and travel throughout the body.diagnosis is made through physical examination and sometimes fluid sample from the boil.treatment may involve incision and drainage of the infection, followed by creams to apply to the site of the boil and/or a course of antibiotic medicine.rarity:uncommontop symptoms:pink or red facial bump, small facial lump, painful facial bump, marble sized facial lump, constant skin changessymptoms that always occur with boil

hormonal imbalances; by endometriosis tissue, if it attaches to the ovary; and by severe pelvic infections that spread to the ovaries. cysts may also form during pregnancy.small ovarian cysts often cause no symptoms. larger cysts may cause pelvic pain, backache, unexplained weight gain, abnormal vaginal bleeding, and/or pain during sex. ovarian cysts are almost never a form of cancer.sudden, severe abdominal pain could indicate a ruptured cyst. this is a medical emergency and the patient should go to an emergency room or call 9-1-1.diagnosis is made through ultrasound.hormonal birth

include a large, red, swollen, painful lump of pus anywhere on the body beneath the skin. there may be fever, chills, and body aches from the infection.if not treated, there is the risk of an abscess enlarging, spreading, and causing serious illness.diagnosis is made through physical examination.a small abscess may heal on its own, through the body\\'s immune system. but some will need to be

unknown. you can learn more about what may be causing your stomach cramps in the following sections.dietary stomach cramps causescauses of stomach cramps may be related to your eating habits, especially if you change them suddenly.overeating:if you overeat, your stomach will be forced to stretch to accommodate a higher volume of food.spicy or oily foods:eating new or rich dishes that your

cramps). this list does not constitute medical advice and may not accurately represent what you have.menstrual crampsmenstrual cramps, also called dysmenorrhea, are actually contractions of the uterus as it expels its lining during a woman\\'s monthly period.a certain amount of mild cramping is normal, triggered by hormone-like substances called prostaglandins. however, painful cramps may be caused by underlying conditions such as endometriosis, uterine fibroids, high prostaglandin levels, or pelvic inflammatory disease (pid.)severe cramping may be present, as well as nausea, headache, and dull pain that radiates to the low back and thighs. it is most common in women under age 30 who smoke, have heavy and irregular periods, and have never given birth.an obstetrician/gynecologist (women\\'s specialist) can do tests for underlying conditions such as those mentioned above. women over age 25 who suddenly begin having severe cramps should see a doctor to rule out the sudden onset of a more serious concern.treatment of mild cramping can be done with heating pads to the abdomen and with over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen. birth control pills, which regulate the menstrual cycle, are often effective in lessening cramps.rarity:commontop symptoms:abdominal pain (stomach ache), abdominal cramps (stomach cramps), painful periods, lower back pain, abdominal pain that shoots

menstrual cycle.each month, one of the two ovaries forms a follicle that holds an egg cell. the pain occurs when the follicle ruptures and releases the egg.this is a dull, cramping sensation that may begin suddenly in only one side of the lower abdomen. in a few cases, there may be vaginal spotting. mittelschmerz occurs about 14 days before the start of the next menstrual period.actual mittelschmerz is not associated with nausea, vomiting, fever, or severe pelvic pain. these symptoms should be evaluated by a medical provider since they can indicate a more serious condition.diagnosis is made through patient history.treatment requires only over-the-counter, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to relieve the pain. an oral contraceptive will stop the symptoms, since it also stops

more common during pregnancy, abdominal pain \\\\u2014 if it is unusual or particularly severe \\\\u2014 may need examination by a medical professional. stomach pain is worrisome if it is accompanied by vaginal bleeding[15], dizziness, clamminess, fever, or fainting.what causes stomach cramps after eating?stomach cramps after eating can be caused by stretching of the stomach after a prolonged fast, a particularly large amount of food, a rapid change in the ph (or acidity) of the stomach[15], or ingestion of any number of toxins. it is most commonly a benign condition that resolves with time.what causes stomach cramps and diarrhea?diarrhea is caused by either inadequate absorption of liquid by the intestines, causing watery stool, or hyperactivity of the stomach and intestines giving insufficient time for absorption of nutrients within the bowels. essentially, food moves through the bowels too fast due to increased activity of both the stomach and the intestines[16].can you experience stomach cramps from menstruation?yes, it is possible to experience stomach cramps accompanying menstruation. during menstruation, prostaglandins \\\\u2014 chemicals associated with female fertility \\\\u2014 are released[17]. this chemical can cause non-rhythmic contractions of the uterus at a low frequency. when the uterus contracts, it can squeeze out blood and block return blood flow. this lack of blood flow can cause the sensation of a cramp[18].questions your doctor may ask about abdominal cramps (stomach cramps)to diagnose this condition, your doctor would likely ask the following questions:have you experienced any nausea?any fever today or during the last week?have you been feeling more tired than usual, lethargic or fatigued despite sleeping a normal amount?have you

severe abdominal pain conditionstreatments and relieffaqsquestions your doctor may askstatisticsreferencessevere abdominal pain symptomssevere abdominal pain is often referred to by the medical term acute abdomen[1]. acute abdomen represents the rapid onset of severe symptoms that is always the result of an underlying problem.severe abdominal painalso requires urgent care and immediate intervention.common accompanying symptoms of abdominal painalong with severe abdominal pain, you may experience:fevernauseavomitingtenderness when you touch the stomachdiarrhea that can be bloodycrampingabdominal distensionbloatingabdominal rigidityalso pay attention to the quality and location of the pain. your pain may be localized and limited to one area of the abdomen. it may be intermittent, or colicky, which is a term that describes pain that is sudden and feels like a severe muscle spasm[2]. the pain may feel cramping and give you a tightening feeling in your stomach.severe abdominal pain causescauses of severe abdominal pain symptoms are broad and the list may seem daunting - making it all the more important for you to seek medical attention as soon as possible if you experience symptoms[3].inflammatory causesinflammation of the organs or structures around the abdomen can result in severe abdominal pain.organ inflammation:conditions that cause inflammation to the organs of the abdomen can result in sudden abdominal pain that persists and worsens over time. for example, appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix that results in abdominal pain that often starts around the belly button and travels to theright lower abdomen. the pain can be extremely severe and debilitating. inflammation of the pancreas is pancreatitis and usually associated with nausea and vomiting. other abdominal organs that can be inflamed causing severe pain include the gall bladder, liver and kidneys.infection:bacterial and viral infections that affect the abdomen can also result in severe abdominal pain. the general medical term for an intestinal infection is gastroenteritis. often the pain associated with these conditions results in vomiting, diarrhea and nausea.obstructive causesan obstruction somewhere in the abdomen can result in severe pain.intestinal:many things can cause obstruction in the intestine that blocks food or liquid from passing through normally. often fibrous bands of tissue called adhesions will form in the abdomen after surgery or other inflammatory conditions and lead to obstruction. when these adhesions are not treated, they block blood flow (ischemia) resulting in severe abdominal pain symptoms. hernias and diverticula (bulging pouches in the digestive tract) can also cause such obstruction. sometimes the intestines can twist on itself causing obstruction in a condition called intestinal volvulus.stones:hardened materials of calcium, digestive fluid, and other substances can form and deposit in different organs of the abdomen leading to obstruction and severe abdominal pain[4]. the kidney and gallbladder are parts of the abdomen that are very susceptible to stone formation. these stones not only block but also irritate the surrounding organ resulting in pain and discomfort that can be exacerbated with things like eating or moving.reproductive causessevere pain due to issues with the reproductive system may be felt in the abdomen.male:a condition called testicular torsion in males can result in severe referred abdominal pain symptoms. torsion occurs when the testicle rotates around the spermatic cord. this condition can result in a lump because the twisting can block blood flow to the scrotum. this blockage will result in buildup and swelling that can appear as a lump. torsion is extremely painful and extremely dangerous.female:complications of pregnancy such as miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy can result in severe abdominal pain in addition tovaginal bleeding. in non-pregnant women, conditions such as ovarian torsion (when the ovary twists arounds it\\'s cord and limits blood flow) as well as ovarian cyst rupture can result in sharp, severe abdominal pain.traumatic causesdirect trauma to the abdomen such as in a car accident can result in injury and or rupture of the organs. the spleen and liver are organs especially susceptible to rupture during traumatic situations and the resulting blood in the abdomen can irritate the lining of the stomach and further exacerbate pain.10 possible severe abdominal pain conditionsthe list below shows results

questions about severe abdominal pain.when should i be concerned about a stomach ache?you should be concerned about abdominal pain if you are also experiencing dizziness, loss of consciousness, a rigid abdomen, or pain that worsens severely if an individual is moved. additionally, blood in feces or vomiting, chest pain, or an indication that you might be pregnant are also concerning.why do i have severe stomach pain during my period?severe stomach or abdominal pain during your period can be caused by endometriosis, a disorder in which tissue that usually lines the uterus migrates to areas beyond the uterus. this tissue grows and sloughs off in concert with the woman\\'s menstrual period. this can cause tenderness, pain during sex, and severe abdominal pain during a period. alternatively, an ectopic pregnancy or pregnancy in which the embryo is somewhere other than the uterus can cause pain but usually much later.why do certain foods cause severe stomach pain?certain foods can cause severe stomach pain by causing stomach cramps. if you have an ulcer, foods that require vigorous motion to digest or foods that contain acid can cause severe stomach pain. additionally, foods that are hard may also cause cramps. foods that are high in fiber, contain large amounts of lactose, or tough meats can also cause severe stomach pain.questions your doctor may ask

stomach hurt?your stomach may hurt for a variety of reasons. indigestion due to a large meal, a lack of food, or gas are the most common reasons. the most common pathologic reasons is a \\\\\"stomach bug\\\\\" or an infection of the stomach that usually resolves in seven to 10 days. if your stomach pain does not resolve, you should visit a healthcare provider for an evaluation.why does the top of my stomach hurt?the top of your stomach may hurt because of heartburn or reflux of stomach acid into the bottom portion of the esophagus. the stomach is divided into different regions. the top of the stomach is called the \\\\\"cardia\\\\\" and this region connects to the esophagus, the tube that food travels through. the cardia can cause pain when stomach acid splashes up through the opening between the esophagus and stomach and burns the lower end of the esophagus.what causes sharp pain in the stomach?sharp pain in the stomach can be caused by indigestion, stomach or intestinal infection, ulcer, or a stomach tumor. indigestion and stomach infections usually self-resolve and are much more common. many sharp stomach pains are benign, and if they happen infrequently, they can be ignored. \\\\\"infrequently\\\\\" is considered not frequently enough to be remembered. additionally, sharp pains may also come from intense muscle contractions associated with vomiting. however, in this case, it is best to treat the cause of vomiting as the sharp pains will diminish as vomiting stops.what causes pain in the lower abdomen?pain in the lower abdomen can be caused by problems with the descending colon, rectum, or genitalia. to determine the cause of pain in the lower abdomen, it is important to recall what activities have occurred recently. have you been constipated? have you had trouble urinating? have you been sick in any way recently? have you eaten anything unusual or taken any prescribed or illicit drugs recently? pain in the lower abdomen is commonly caused by stretching or tension placed on organs. whether muscle contractions during an upset stomach, stretching of bowel from constipation, or an overfull bladder pressing on other organs, lower abdominal pain is commonly caused by stretching of an organ irritating a nerve. the other common cause of lower abdominal pain is inflammation which can occur in the setting of infection or, more rarely, malignancy.why does my stomach hurt after i eat?your stomach may hurt after you eat if you haven\\'t eaten in a long time, if you\\'ve eaten a particularly large meal, or if you have an ulcer, tumor, or other mass that is not protected from stomach acid by mucus within the stomach. stomach pain after eating is most commonly caused by the normal contractions/motions of the stomach as it churns and breaks down food with stomach acid. if you have damage to the stomach or a mass of some sort, these motions can aggravate that point of tenderness causing additional stomach pain. gas is also a common cause of stomach pain after eating. an antacid or fizzy drink may help you belch, releasing the gas and discomfort.questions your doctor may ask about abdominal pain (stomach ache)to diagnose this condition, your doctor would likely ask the following questions:have you experienced any nausea?any fever today or during the last week?how would you describe the nature of your abdominal pain?have you been feeling more tired than usual, lethargic or fatigued despite sleeping a normal amount?the above questions are also covered by our a.i. health assistant.if you\\'ve answered yes to one or more

difficulty in passing bowel movements. a common cause of constipation is dehydration, or insufficient water in the body. if the contents of the bowel are not kept full and lubricated by plenty of fluid, the waste can become dry and packed and very hard to pass.most susceptible are pregnant women, especially those with a condition called hyperemesis gravidarum. this syndrome causes severe nausea and vomiting throughout most of the pregnancy and can easily lead to dehydration.anyone with an illness that causes prolonged vomiting and diarrhea will soon become dehydrated. a number of prescription medications can act as diuretics, meaning they cause the body to lose extra fluid through the urine.the use of alcohol, or illegal drugs such as cocaine, also has a very dehydrating

that gets worse after eating, or postprandial pain, can present with a frustrating set of symptoms. maybe you were hoping a few crackers would settle your stomach pains, especially if you hadn\\'t eaten much earlier in the day, but instead, you\\'re in more pain than you were before. abdominal pain that gets worse after eating can actually be due to a wide variety of causes, making it important to seek care.common characteristics of abdominal pain that gets worse after eatingpostprandial pain in itself has a strong connection to food that you eat. most people can even pinpoint which foods trigger their symptoms the most. for example, it\\'s common to experience symptoms after eating spicy food or food that\\'s high in fat content. indigestion (also known as dyspepsia) is also a common characteristic. indigestion is persistent discomfort or pain in the upper abdomen.common accompanying symptoms of abdominal pain that gets worse after eatingpostprandial pain may also be associated with the following:feverheartburnnausea and vomitingconstipation and/or diarrheabloatingbelchingjaundice:this is a yellow tint or appearance of the skin.depending on the cause, postprandial pain and associated symptoms can be very severe and last for many minutes. make an appointment with your healthcare provider as soon as you notice any of these symptoms.abdominal pain that get worse after eating causespostprandial pain occurs when there is either inflammation/irritation of the structures of the digestive tract or obstruction of these components. you experience pain after you eat because your body is attempting to digest food normally, but is having to do so within the context of injury.inflammatory causesany of the organs of the abdomen can become inflamed due to infectious causes or irritation from a variety of substances, including certain foods.infectious:there are many pathogens, both bacterial and viral, that can infect the organs of the abdomen, particularly in the upper right quadrant. for example, hepatitis is a viral infection that can infect the liver.irritation:since the upper abdomen is the primary location for food to be processed for digestion, it is susceptible to irritation in multiple ways. toxic substances such as alcohol and smoking can cause irritation that leads to inflammation and ulceration. certain medications such as non-steroidal inflammatory drugs (nsaids) can lead to irritation of the stomach lining with overuse. moreover, the acid that the stomach makes to digest food can irritate the components of the digestive tract, including the esophagus, and this can also cause postprandial pain.obstructive causesthe following can result in obstructions of the gastrointestinal system.cancer:cancer can develop in any organ of the abdomen/digestive tract. malignancies of the pancreas or stomach are often related to postprandial pain given their necessity to proper digestion.gallstones:the upper right quadrant of the abdomen is specifically home to the gallbladder. the gallbladder is part of the digestive system and responsible for making bile, a fluid that helps break down fat. often, stones (gallstones) can form inside the gallbladder. these gallstones can vary in size and cause many problems that may result in postprandial pain when the body tries to break down fats.10 possible abdominal pain that get worse after

treatments and relieftreatment for your postprandial pain will be dependent on the cause. there are multiple treatment modalities that may provide relief.at-home treatmentsfortunately, since most causes of postprandial pain are relatively benign, there are treatments you can first try at home to help alleviate your symptoms. antacids are common over-the-counter medications (tums, pepto-bismol, etc.) that can be very helpful in relieving some causes of postprandial pain because they work to neutralize excess stomach acid. however, antacids will not help with inflammatory or obstructive causes of postprandial pain.when to see a doctorif your symptoms persist despite the at-home remedies above, make an appointment with your doctor to receive a proper diagnosis. once your doctor has determined a possible cause, he or she may recommend:medications:for example, in the case of gallstones, there are some medications that can break them up without the need for surgery. if your symptoms are due to infection, you may receive antibiotics to relieve your condition.surgery:surgery to remove gallstones or the gallbladder entirely is a very common procedure, especially for people who suffer from chronic gallstones. often, the entire gallbladder is removed.bowel rest:your doctor may suggest a lighter diet that will allow your intestines and digestive system to recover after inflammatory or infectious causes of abdominal pain[2].when it is an emergencyseek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms including:sudden, severe painfeverbloody stoolsnausea and vomiting that persistsweight losssevere tenderness when you touch your abdomenswelling of the abdomenthese could be signs of a serious obstruction or inflammation of the organs of the abdomen that needs immediate assessment.preventionthere are also many strategies you can try in order to stay a step ahead of your symptoms.limit nsaid use:non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (advil, motrin) or naproxen (aleve) can cause and/or aggravate postprandial pain. talk to your doctor about alternatives you can use.limit consumption of spicy, fatty, or acidic foods:certain foods in these categories (caffeine, carbonated beverages, citrus fruits or juices, etc.) are believed to be triggers of postprandial pain.avoid alcohol and quit smoking:alcohol and smoking are associated with increased production of stomach acid and thus irritation of the abdominal lining.faqs about abdominal pain that get worse after eatingcan i prevent postprandial pain?yes, depending on the cause. making lifestyle changes, such as limiting your use of alcohol or nsaids, can also reduce the chance for ulceration of your stomach lining (peptic or gastric ulcers). you can also prevent symptoms by stopping smoking or not taking up smoking in the first place.what is helicobacter pylori?helicobacter pylori are bacteria that specifically infect the gastrointestinal tract. the inflammation and irritation this bacteria causes can lead to conditions such as gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and even gastric cancer. more than half of the world\\\\u2019s population is colonized by these bacteria[3]. fortunately, the management and treatment of helicobacter pylori infections are well-studied.how are helicobacter pylori transmitted?even though there are many hypotheses for how helicobacter pylori are transmitted, their major mode of transmission is not specifically known. possible routes of infection include oral-oral (from human saliva to human saliva), fecal-oral (accidental contamination of food with feces), and sometimes spread via inadvertent use of unsterile medical equipment such as probes or endoscopes[4].how can i live without my gallbladder?gallbladder removal is a very common surgery. removal of the gallbladder does not significantly affect digestion because the liver can also make bile to help with the break down of fatty foods. symptoms experienced after gallbladder removal include gas, bloating, or more watery bowel movements. fortunately, there is a very small chance that gallstones will recur after removal.is postprandial pain life-threatening?some causes of postprandial pain such as pancreatitis can be very serious and severe. according to a large epidemiologic study from the united states, approximately 15-25% of patients with acute pancreatitis develop severe pancreatitis[5]. severe pancreatitis can result in fever, hypotension, and organ failure and require monitoring in the intensive care unit. it is important to not ignore symptoms of pain in the upper abdomen and seek medical attention before the condition worsens.questions your doctor may ask about abdominal pain that get worse after eatingto diagnose this

muscles of the groin are called the adductor muscles. these muscles allow you to bring your thighs together and work with other muscles in movements such as bringing the knees to the chest. furthermore, the muscles of the abdomen also connect in this area.fat:there is a layer of fatty tissue under the skin that stores energy, insulates/regulates the body\\\\u2019s temperature and serves as a protective cushion.lymphatics:underneath the skin, there are three to five lymph nodes \\\\u2014 structures throughout the body that play an important role in allowing the body to fight off infectionsother conditions in the following sections can also lead to the development of a hard abdominal lump[1].herniaa hernia occurs when part of an organ pushes through an opening or weakness in the muscles or tissues that surround it[2]. the protruding organ can result in a noticeable lump or bulge in the area. usually, a hard lump in the abdomen is the result of the following:surgical:a surgical incision is essentially the creation of a weakness in the abdominal wall. after surgery, the abdominal wall is closed; however, factors such as weight gain, pregnancy, or excessive activity too soon after the procedure can result in an increase in abdominal pressure and stretching of the incision before it is completely healed. this makes it easy for contents to protrude through the incision, resulting in a hernia[3].developmental:a developmental hernia, also called umbilical hernia, arises when intestinal content protrudes through the hole the umbilical cord passed through at birth[4]. this hardlump is located in the area of the belly buttonand is easily identifiable in newborns and small children. there are other types of hernias such as epigastric or spigelian that can also result due to improper development of the abdominal structures[5].other causesother causes that can lead to hard abdominal lumps include:lymphatic:the lymph nodes are structures that contain immune cells that fight infection and filter harmful substances from the body. when these structures become infected, they can swell and result in palpable lumps. the abdomen contains some lymph nodes that are susceptible to infection and swelling. if swollen lymph nodes are causing the lump in your abdomen you may also experience tenderness and fever as well.cancerous:a hard lump in the abdomen, especially in the abdomen of a child, can be a sign of a cancerous condition called neuroblastoma[6]. it is very important to follow up with your physician if you notice a hard lump in that area accompanied by symptoms such as pain, weight loss or an enlarged belly[7].10 possible hard abdominal lump conditionsthe list below shows results from the use of our quiz by buoy users who experienced hard abdominal lump. this list does not constitute medical advice and may not accurately represent what you have.lipomalipoma is a word that translates as \\\\\"fatty tumor,\\\\\" but a lipoma is not cancer. it is simply a growth of fat between the muscle layer and the skin above it.the exact cause is not known. the condition does run in families and is associated with other unusual syndromes such as adiposis dolorosa, which is similar. lipomas most often appear after age 40.symptoms include a soft, easily moveable lump beneath the skin, about two inches across. a lipoma is painless unless its growth is irritating the nerves around it. they are most often found on the back, neck, and abdomen, and sometimes the arms and upper legs.it is a good idea to have any new or unusual growth checked by a medical provider, just to make certain it is benign.diagnosis is made through physical examination, biopsy, and imaging such as ultrasound or ct scan.most of the time, treatment is not necessary unless the lipoma is unsightly or is interfering with other structures. it can be removed through surgery or liposuction.rarity:uncommontop symptoms:skin-colored groin bump, marble sized groin lump, small groin lumpsymptoms that always occur with lipoma:skin-colored groin bumpurgency:wait and watchskin cysta cyst is a small sac or lump, filled with fluid, air, fat, or other material, that begins to grow somewhere in the body for no apparent reason. a skin cyst is one that forms just beneath the skin.it\\'s believed that skin cysts form around trapped keratin cells \\\\u2013 the cells that form the relatively tough outer layer of the skin.these cysts are not contagious.anyone can get a skin cyst, but they are most common in those who are over age 18, have acne, or have injured the skin.symptoms include the appearance of a small, rounded lump under the skin. cysts are normally painless unless infected, when they will be reddened and sore and contain pus.diagnosis is made through physical examination. a small cyst can be left alone, though if it is unsightly or large enough to interfere with movement it can be removed in a simple procedure done in a doctor\\'s office. an infected cyst must be treated so that the infection does not spread.rarity:commontop symptoms:skin-colored armpit bump, marble sized armpit lump, small armpit lumpsymptoms that always occur with skin cyst:skin-colored armpit bumpurgency:wait and watchskin abscessa skin abscess is a large pocket of pus that has formed just beneath the skin. it is caused by bacteria getting under the skin, usually through a small cut or scratch, and beginning to multiply. the body fights the invasion with white blood cells, which kill some of the infected tissue but form pus within the cavity that remains.symptoms include a large, red, swollen, painful lump of pus anywhere on the body beneath the skin. there may be fever, chills, and body aches from the infection.if not treated, there is the risk of an abscess enlarging, spreading, and causing serious illness.diagnosis is made through physical examination.a small abscess may heal on its own, through the body\\'s immune system. but some will need to be drained or lanced in a medical provider\\'s office so that the pus can be cleaned out. antibiotics are usually prescribed.keeping the skin clean, and using only clean clothes and towels, will help to make sure that the abscess does not recur.rarity:commontop symptoms:rash with bumps or blisters, red rash, red skin bump larger than 1/2 cm in diameter, pus-filled rash, rashsymptoms that always occur with skin abscess:rash with bumps or blistersurgency:primary care doctorovarian cystduring her reproductive years, a woman\\'s ovaries release a single egg cell each month. but sometimes the egg remains on the surface of the ovary, where the follicle that enclosed it continues to grow. it then becomes a fluid-filled ovarian cyst.ovarian cysts may be caused by hormonal imbalances; by endometriosis tissue, if it attaches to the ovary; and by severe pelvic infections that spread to the ovaries. cysts may also form during pregnancy.small ovarian cysts often cause no symptoms. larger cysts may cause pelvic pain, backache, unexplained weight gain, abnormal vaginal bleeding, and/or pain during sex. ovarian cysts are almost never a form of cancer.sudden, severe abdominal pain could indicate a ruptured cyst. this is a medical emergency and the patient should go to an emergency room or call 9-1-1.diagnosis is made through ultrasound.hormonal birth control, such as the pill, injection, or patch, prevents ovulation and therefore prevents the formation of cysts. surgery to remove the cyst may be necessary in some cases.rarity:raretop

and most often appear during childbearing years. fibroids are almost never associated with cancer.those at higher risk include black women and women who started their periods at a young age. other risk factors are vitamin d deficiency, poor diet, obesity, drinking alcohol, and family history of fibroids.fibroids can cause pelvic pressure and pain, severe menstrual cramping, and heavy menstrual bleeding that leads to anemia. quality of life is diminished due to the chronic pain and discomfort. though fibroids don\\'t always make it impossible to become pregnant, infertility and pregnancy loss may occur as well as pre-term delivery.fibroids can be diagnosed through a routine pelvic exam or ultrasound in a doctor\\'s office.a gynecologist can prescribe various medications to ease the symptoms and regulate the menstrual cycle. there are also a number of surgical techniques, some minimally invasive, to shrink or remove the fibroids while leaving the uterus in place. hysterectomy, or removal of the uterus, is an option in some cases.rarity:commontop symptoms:vaginal bleeding, pelvis pain, abdominal cramps (stomach cramps), painful periods, irregular periodurgency:primary care

doctorwhen and how to treat a hard lump on the stomachwhen to see a doctorsince the causes of hard abdominal lumps are varied, it is important to make an appointment with your physician in order to get the proper diagnosis and treatment. depending on the cause of your symptoms, your physician may suggest:surgery:if an incisional or an umbilical hernia is causing your hard abdominal lump, your physician may suggest open or non-invasive surgery to relieve discomfort and prevent complications. however, if your hernia is not causing you significant pain or discomfort, your physician may suggest watchful waiting.antibiotics:if you have swollen lymph nodes due to infection, your physician will provide appropriate antibiotic treatment.cancer treatment:if your hard abdominal lump and associated symptoms are due to cancer, your physician will discuss treatment options including surgery, radiation or chemotherapy.when it is an emergencyseek immediate treatment in an emergency room or call 911 if the following occur:nauseaand/orvomitingfeverpain that is sudden and increases in intensitylump changes colorinability to pass gasthese could be signs of an incarcerated hernia. a hernia is incarcerated when it becomes trapped in the abdominal wall. incarcerated hernias are dangerous because they can wrap around themselves and cut off blood flow to the trapped tissue. when this occurs, a strangulated hernia results, which can have life-threatening consequences if not treated promptly.faqs about hard abdominal lumpwhy can my hard abdominal lump be moved/pushed back into my abdomen sometimes?this phenomenon is called reducibility. often the protrusion of contents can be easily pushed back into the opening or weakness, signaling that the lump can be fixed or treated by properly closing the hole. often reduction of the lump can help alleviate associated symptoms and delay the need for surgery.will a hard abdominal lump affect my digestion?depending on the cause of your hard abdominal lump, your digestion may be affected. in the case of cancer, a growth may block the flow of food and affect digestion as well as cause symptoms such as pain, nausea, and vomiting. however, in the case of conditions such as incisional or umbilical hernias, the digestion is not usually affected.can i still exercise with a hard abdominal lump?exercise is acceptable if you take precautions to avoid aggravating the abdominal tissues or increasing intra-abdominal pressure. low-intensity or low-impact exercises such as dancing, walking or water aerobics may be good options. however, activities such as heavy weightlifting can cause strain in that area and increase pressure in the abdomen causing the lump to bulge unnecessarily. always speak with your physician before beginning an exercise regimen.after repairing my abdominal lump, when can i start exercise?when you can resume exercise and other physical activity will depend on the size of your lump and the type of repair that was performed. however, most people can return to their normal level of physical activity after four to six weeks.can a hard abdominal lump be inherited?some abdominal lumps related to cancerous processes can be inherited. for example, the mutation that causes some forms of neuroblastoma in children can be inherited. however, for conditions such as surgical or developmental hernias, there is no hereditary component.questions your doctor may ask about hard abdominal lumpto diagnose this condition, your doctor would likely ask the following questions:what color is the bump?how

diminished due to the chronic pain and discomfort. though fibroids don\\'t always make it impossible to become pregnant, infertility and pregnancy loss may occur as well as pre-term delivery.fibroids can be diagnosed through a routine pelvic exam or ultrasound in a doctor\\'s office.a gynecologist can prescribe various medications to ease the symptoms and regulate the menstrual cycle. there are also a number of surgical techniques, some minimally invasive, to shrink or remove the fibroids while leaving the uterus in place. hysterectomy, or removal of the uterus, is an option in some cases.rarity:commontop symptoms:vaginal bleeding, pelvis pain, abdominal cramps (stomach cramps), painful periods, irregular periodurgency:primary care doctorchronic constipationconstipation is a very

urinary tract, the pancreas, the gall bladder, or the gynecologic organs.the pain may simply be caused by overly sensitive nerves in the gut. this hypersensitivity can occur after repeated abdominal injury and/or it may have an emotional cause due to fear of the pain itself.diagnosis is made through physical examination, patient history, and simply ruling out any other condition. ct scan is often requested, but can rarely find a specific cause. the benefits must be weighed against the risks of radiation.treatment first involves making any needed lifestyle improvements regarding diet, exercise,

uterine fibroids, high prostaglandin levels, or pelvic inflammatory disease (pid.)severe cramping may be present, as well as nausea, headache, and dull pain that radiates to the low back and thighs. it is most common in women under age 30 who smoke, have heavy and irregular periods, and have never given birth.an obstetrician/gynecologist (women\\'s specialist) can do tests for underlying conditions such as those mentioned above. women over age 25 who suddenly begin having severe cramps should see a doctor to rule out the sudden onset of a more serious concern.treatment of mild cramping can be done with heating pads to the abdomen and with over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen. birth control pills, which regulate the menstrual cycle, are often effective in lessening cramps.rarity:commontop symptoms:abdominal pain (stomach ache), abdominal cramps (stomach cramps), painful periods, lower back pain, abdominal pain that shoots to the backsymptoms that

you prevent them in the first place.slow down at mealtime:if you tend to overeat, try having smaller meals, eating more slowly, and taking time to chew carefully. there are many benefits to chewing slowly[7].eat with caution:if you\\'re trying new or spicy food, go slow and don\\'t be afraid to pass on certain options.avoid common offenders:if you can\\'t tolerate dairy or gluten, you should avoid these ingredients and be sure to check food labels carefully. fortunately, foods are increasingly well-marked with common allergens.at-home treatmentstaking more medications or supplements may

(stomach cramps)here are some frequently asked questions about abdominal cramps (stomach cramps).is it normal to have stomach pain during pregnancy?while heartburn or indigestion and vomiting[13]are more common during pregnancy, abdominal pain \\\\u2014 if it is unusual or particularly severe \\\\u2014 may need examination by a medical professional. stomach pain is worrisome if it is accompanied by vaginal bleeding[15], dizziness, clamminess, fever, or fainting.what causes stomach cramps after eating?stomach cramps after eating can be caused by stretching of the stomach after a prolonged fast, a particularly large amount of food, a rapid change in the ph (or acidity) of the stomach[15], or ingestion of any number of toxins. it is most commonly a benign condition that resolves with time.what causes stomach cramps and diarrhea?diarrhea is caused by either inadequate absorption of liquid by the intestines, causing watery stool, or hyperactivity of the stomach and intestines giving insufficient time for absorption of nutrients within the bowels. essentially, food moves through the bowels too fast due to increased activity of both the stomach and the intestines[16].can you experience stomach cramps from menstruation?yes, it is possible to experience stomach cramps accompanying menstruation. during menstruation, prostaglandins \\\\u2014 chemicals associated with female fertility \\\\u2014 are released[17]. this chemical can cause non-rhythmic contractions of the uterus at a low frequency. when the uterus contracts, it can squeeze out blood and block return blood flow. this lack of blood flow can cause the sensation of a cramp[18].questions your doctor may ask about abdominal cramps (stomach cramps)to diagnose this condition, your doctor would likely ask the following questions:have you experienced any nausea?any fever today or during the last week?have you been feeling more tired than usual, lethargic or fatigued despite sleeping a normal amount?have you lost your appetite recently?the above questions are also covered by our a.i. health assistant.if you\\'ve answered yes to one or more of these questionstake a quiz to find out what might be causing

symptomssevere abdominal pain is often referred to by the medical term acute abdomen[1]. acute abdomen represents the rapid onset of severe symptoms that is always the result of an underlying problem.severe abdominal painalso requires urgent care and immediate intervention.common accompanying symptoms of abdominal painalong with severe abdominal pain, you may experience:fevernauseavomitingtenderness when you touch the stomachdiarrhea that can be bloodycrampingabdominal distensionbloatingabdominal rigidityalso pay attention to the quality and location of the pain. your pain may be localized and limited to one area of the abdomen. it may be intermittent, or colicky, which is a term that describes pain that is sudden and feels like a severe muscle spasm[2]. the pain may feel cramping and give you a tightening feeling in your stomach.severe abdominal pain causescauses of severe abdominal pain symptoms are broad and the list may seem daunting - making it all the more important for you to seek medical attention as soon as possible if you experience symptoms[3].inflammatory causesinflammation of the organs or structures around the abdomen can result in severe abdominal pain.organ inflammation:conditions that cause inflammation to the organs of the abdomen can result in sudden abdominal pain that persists and worsens over time. for example, appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix that results in abdominal pain that often starts around the belly button and travels to theright lower abdomen. the pain can be extremely severe and debilitating. inflammation of the pancreas is pancreatitis and usually associated with nausea and vomiting. other abdominal organs that can be inflamed causing severe pain include the gall bladder, liver and kidneys.infection:bacterial and viral infections that affect the abdomen can also result in severe abdominal pain. the general medical term for an intestinal infection is gastroenteritis. often the pain associated with these conditions results in vomiting, diarrhea and nausea.obstructive causesan obstruction somewhere in the abdomen can result in severe pain.intestinal:many things can cause obstruction in the intestine that blocks food or liquid from passing through normally. often fibrous bands of tissue called adhesions will form in the abdomen after surgery or other inflammatory conditions and lead to obstruction. when these adhesions are not treated, they block blood flow (ischemia) resulting in severe abdominal pain symptoms. hernias and diverticula (bulging pouches in the digestive tract) can also cause such obstruction. sometimes the intestines can twist on itself causing obstruction in a condition called intestinal volvulus.stones:hardened materials of calcium, digestive fluid, and other substances can form and deposit in different organs of the abdomen leading to obstruction and severe abdominal pain[4]. the kidney and gallbladder are parts of the abdomen that are very susceptible to stone formation. these stones not only block but also irritate the surrounding organ resulting in pain and discomfort that can be exacerbated with things like eating or moving.reproductive causessevere pain due to issues with the reproductive system may be felt in the abdomen.male:a condition called testicular torsion in males can result in severe referred abdominal pain symptoms. torsion occurs when the testicle rotates around the spermatic cord. this condition can result in a lump because the twisting can block blood flow to the scrotum. this blockage will result in buildup and swelling that can appear as a lump. torsion is extremely painful and extremely dangerous.female:complications of pregnancy such as miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy can result in severe abdominal pain in addition tovaginal bleeding. in non-pregnant women, conditions such as ovarian torsion (when the ovary twists arounds it\\'s cord and limits blood flow) as well as ovarian cyst rupture can result in sharp, severe abdominal pain.traumatic causesdirect trauma to the abdomen such as in a car accident can result in injury and or rupture of the organs. the spleen and liver are organs especially susceptible to rupture during traumatic situations and the resulting blood in the abdomen can irritate the lining of the stomach and further exacerbate pain.10 possible severe

abdominal pain if you are also experiencing dizziness, loss of consciousness, a rigid abdomen, or pain that worsens severely if an individual is moved. additionally, blood in feces or vomiting, chest pain, or an indication that you might be pregnant are also concerning.why do i have severe stomach pain during my period?severe stomach or abdominal pain during your period can be caused by endometriosis, a disorder in which tissue that usually lines the uterus migrates to areas beyond the uterus. this tissue grows and sloughs off in concert with the woman\\'s menstrual period. this can cause tenderness, pain during sex, and severe abdominal pain during a period. alternatively, an ectopic pregnancy or pregnancy in which the embryo is somewhere other than the uterus can cause pain but usually much later.why do certain foods cause severe stomach pain?certain foods can cause severe stomach pain by causing stomach cramps. if you have an ulcer, foods that require vigorous motion to digest or foods that contain acid can cause severe stomach pain. additionally, foods that are hard may also cause cramps. foods that are high in fiber, contain large amounts of lactose, or tough meats

vitamin/mineral supplements can cause indigestion.the most common symptoms are pain, discomfort, and bloating in the upper abdomen soon after eating.indigestion that lasts longer than two weeks, and

called dysmenorrhea, are actually contractions of the uterus as it expels its lining during a woman\\'s monthly period.a certain amount of mild cramping is normal, triggered by hormone-like substances called prostaglandins. however, painful cramps may be caused by underlying conditions such as endometriosis, uterine fibroids, high prostaglandin levels, or pelvic inflammatory disease (pid.)severe cramping may be present, as well as nausea, headache, and dull pain that radiates to the low back and thighs. it is most common in women under age 30 who smoke, have heavy and irregular periods, and have never given birth.an obstetrician/gynecologist (women\\'s specialist) can do tests for underlying conditions such as those mentioned above. women over age 25 who suddenly begin having severe cramps should see a doctor to rule out the sudden onset of a more serious concern.treatment of mild cramping can be done with heating pads to the abdomen and with over-the-counter pain relievers such

stomach hurt?your stomach may hurt for a variety of reasons. indigestion due to a large meal, a lack of food, or gas are the most common reasons. the most common pathologic reasons is a \\\\\"stomach bug\\\\\" or an infection of the stomach that usually resolves in seven to 10 days. if your stomach pain does not resolve, you should visit a healthcare provider for an evaluation.why does the top of my stomach hurt?the top of your stomach may hurt because of heartburn or reflux of stomach acid into the bottom portion of the esophagus. the stomach is divided into different regions. the top of the stomach is called the \\\\\"cardia\\\\\" and this region connects to the esophagus, the tube that food travels through. the cardia can cause pain when stomach acid splashes up through the opening between the esophagus and stomach and burns the lower end of the esophagus.what causes sharp pain in the stomach?sharp pain in the stomach can be caused by indigestion, stomach or intestinal infection, ulcer, or a stomach tumor. indigestion and stomach infections usually self-resolve and are much more common. many sharp stomach pains are benign, and if they happen infrequently, they can be ignored. \\\\\"infrequently\\\\\" is considered not frequently enough to be remembered. additionally, sharp pains may also come from intense muscle contractions associated with vomiting. however, in this case, it is best to treat the cause of vomiting as the sharp pains will diminish as vomiting stops.what causes pain in the lower abdomen?pain in the lower abdomen can be caused by problems with the descending colon, rectum, or genitalia. to determine the cause of pain in the lower abdomen, it is important to recall what activities have occurred recently. have you been constipated? have you had trouble urinating? have you been sick in any way recently? have you eaten anything unusual or taken any prescribed or illicit drugs recently? pain in the lower abdomen is commonly caused by stretching or tension placed on organs. whether muscle contractions during an upset stomach, stretching of bowel from constipation, or an overfull bladder pressing on other organs, lower abdominal pain is commonly caused by stretching of an organ irritating a nerve. the other common cause of lower abdominal pain is inflammation which can occur in the setting of infection or, more rarely, malignancy.why does my stomach hurt after i eat?your stomach may hurt after you eat if you haven\\'t eaten in a long time, if you\\'ve eaten a particularly large meal, or if you have an ulcer, tumor, or other mass that is not protected from stomach acid by mucus within the stomach. stomach pain after eating is most commonly caused by the normal contractions/motions of the stomach as it churns and breaks down food with stomach acid. if you have damage to the stomach or a mass of some sort, these motions can aggravate that point of tenderness causing additional stomach pain. gas is also a common cause of stomach pain after eating. an antacid or fizzy drink may help you belch, releasing the gas and discomfort.questions your doctor may ask about abdominal pain (stomach ache)to diagnose this condition, your doctor would likely ask the following questions:have you experienced any nausea?any fever today or during the last week?how would you describe the nature of your abdominal pain?have you been feeling more tired than usual, lethargic or fatigued despite sleeping a normal amount?the above questions are also covered by our a.i. health assistant.if you\\'ve answered yes to one or more

susceptible are pregnant women, especially those with a condition called hyperemesis gravidarum. this syndrome causes severe nausea and vomiting throughout most of the pregnancy and can easily lead to
